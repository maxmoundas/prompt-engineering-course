# Prompt Engineering: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)

A comprehensive four-day course on large language models, prompt engineering, and advanced AI applications designed for STEM researchers and practitioners.

## Course Overview

This course provides a thorough introduction to Large Language Models and practical prompt engineering techniques for research applications. The curriculum progresses from foundational concepts to advanced implementation strategies, emphasizing real-world applications, ethical considerations, and emerging technologies in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

### Target Audience

PhD researchers and post-docs from STEM disciplines seeking to understand and leverage generative AI technologies in their research workflows.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computational concepts
- No prior experience with AI or machine learning required
- Interest in applying AI tools to research contexts

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four sessions covering foundational through advanced topics:

### Day 1: Foundations of LLMs (Monday, July 14)
**Core Topics:**
- What are Large Language Models? Architecture and capabilities
- How LLMs work: Transformers, attention mechanisms, and training processes
- Key terminology: Tokens, context windows, temperature, hallucinations
- Major LLM providers and ecosystem (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, AWS)
- Current best models and evaluation methodologies
- Ethical considerations: Copyright, environmental impact, bias, and misuse
- Understanding limitations: Reasoning, accuracy, and the "black box" problem

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand LLM capabilities and fundamental limitations
- Recognize the difference between language understanding and reasoning
- Appreciate ethical implications and responsible use practices
- Identify appropriate use cases for different models and providers

### Day 2: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals (Tuesday, July 15)

### Day 3: RAG & Multimodal LLMs (Thursday, July 17)

### Day 4: Agents & LLM-Assisted Software Engineering (Friday, July 18)
